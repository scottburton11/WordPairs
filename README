=WordPairs
WordPairs outputs pairs of words with alternate spellings. This example produces
word alternates by reversing a variable-length ending word segment.

output: 
    agonies, agonise  # trim = 2
    analog, angola    # trim = 4
    animal, lamina    # trim = 6

WordPairs outputs comma-separated pairs to STDOUT. 

==Usage
  WordPairs.run(words, dictionary, trim)
  
  * The words argument is an Enumerable object that responds to #each containing instances of String.
  * The dictionary argument is a plaintext dictionary instance of String. 
  * The trim argument is any positive integer.
  
==Command-line usage
See bin/wordpairs, or bin/wordpairs -h, for details.

==Assumptions

  * In order to provide complete output, matched words are not removed from the dictionary. 
  * Word alternates must be unique and longer than the provided trim length to be eligible for matching.
  * Compound hyphenated words, abbreviations and contractions are eligible for matching.
  * Terms containing multiple words (eg. "St. Tropez") are eligible for matching if provided, but are 
    broken down into individual words in the default word list.
